# Executables & Binaries
Contains the executable versions of the tools for Reentry. Keep in mind that these Mission Editors are very basic and has been created just to get a functional job done. All of the editors will be completly rewritten.

Contribute?
If you feel like it, feel free to create your own mission editors. You can find the data structures and the JSON format in the source code for each of them. Right now, there is only a basic version of the editors, but a web version and a better windows version is needed.

What's in this Repo?
Use the Apollo, Gemini and/or Mercury Mission Editors to make missions.
Use the Campaign Maker to combine missions into campaigns.
- A campaign can have missions from one or multiple programs, so Campaign X can for example have 2 Mercury Missions, 1 Gemini Mission and 4 Apollo Missions etc.
